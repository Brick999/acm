
Problem Statement
ÿÿÿÿ
You want to send a group of salespeople from location 0 to location 1, but no two of them can travel through the same location (other than 0 and 1). This removes the possibility of trying to sell a customer the same product twice. Character j of element i (both 0-based) of adj denotes whether locations i and j are connected by a symmetric link ('1' for connected, '0' otherwise). Return the greatest number of salespeople that can be sent. The constraints will guarantee that locations 0 and 1 do not share a link.
