                  Three problems numbered 6 through 8
**********************************************************************

Problem 6: The Cow Prom [Brian Dean, 2004]

The N (2 &lt;= N &lt;= 10,000) cows are so excited: it's prom night! They
are dressed in their finest gowns, complete with corsages and new
shoes. They know that tonight they will each try to perform the
Round Dance.

Only cows can perform the Round Dance which requires a set of ropes
and a circular stock tank. To begin, the cows line up around a
circular stock tank and number themselves in clockwise order
consecutively from 1..N. Each cow faces the tank so she can see the
other dancers.

They then acquire a total of M (2 &lt;= M &lt;= 50,000) ropes all of which
are distributed to the cows who hold them in their hooves.  Each
cow hopes to be given one or more ropes to hold in both her left
and right hooves; some cows might be disappointed.

For the Round Dance to succeed for any given cow (say, Bessie), the
ropes that she holds must be configured just right. To know if
Bessie's dance is successful, one must examine the set of cows
holding the other ends of her ropes (if she has any), along with
the cows holding the other ends of any ropes they hold, etc.  When
Bessie dances clockwise around the tank, she must instantly pull
all the other cows in her group around clockwise, too. Likewise,
if she dances the other way, she must instantly pull the entire
group counterclockwise (anti-clockwise in British English).

Of course, if the ropes are not properly distributed then a set of
cows might not form a proper dance group and thus can not succeed
at the Round Dance. One way this happens is when only one rope
connects two cows. One cow could pull the other in one direction,
but could not pull the other direction (since pushing ropes is
well-known to be fruitless). Note that the cows must Dance in
lock-step: a dangling cow (perhaps with just one rope) that is
eventually pulled along disqualifies a group from properly performing
the Round Dance since she is not immediately pulled into lockstep
with the rest.

Given the ropes and their distribution to cows, how many groups of
cows can properly perform the Round Dance? Note that a set of ropes
and cows might wrap many times around the stock tank.

PROBLEM NAME: prom

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and M

* Lines 2..M+1: Each line contains two space-separated integers A and
        B that describe a rope from cow A to cow B in the clockwise
        direction.

SAMPLE INPUT (file prom.in):

5 4
2 4
3 5
1 2
4 1

INPUT DETAILS:

ASCII art for Round Dancing is challenging. Nevertheless, here is a
representation of the cows around the stock tank:
       _1___
      /**** \
   5 /****** 2
  / /**TANK**|
  \ \********/
   \ \******/  3
    \ 4____/  /
     \_______/

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single line with a single integer that is the number of
        groups successfully dancing the Round Dance.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file prom.out):

1

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Cows 1, 2, and 4 are properly connected and form a complete Round
Dance group. Cows 3 and 5 don't have the second rope they'd need
to be able to pull both ways, thus they can not properly perform the
Round Dance.

Problem 7: Dollar Dayz [Don Piele, 2003]

Farmer John goes to Dollar Days at The Cow Store and discovers an
unlimited number of tools on sale. During his first visit, the tools
are selling variously for $1, $2, and $3. Farmer John has exactly
$5 to spend. He can buy 5 tools at $1 each or 1 tool at $3 and an
additional 1 tool at $2. Of course, there are other combinations
for a total of 5 different ways FJ can spend all his money on tools.
Here they are:

        1 @ US$3 + 1 @ US$2
        1 @ US$3 + 2 @ US$1
        1 @ US$2 + 3 @ US$1
        2 @ US$2 + 1 @ US$1
        5 @ US$1

Write a program than will compute the number of ways FJ can spend
N dollars (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000) at The Cow Store for tools on sale with
a cost of $1..$K (1 &lt;= K &lt;= 100).

PROBLEM NAME: ddayz

INPUT FORMAT:

A single line with two space-separated integers: N and K.

SAMPLE INPUT (file ddayz.in):

5 3

OUTPUT FORMAT:

A single line with a single integer that is the number of unique ways
FJ can spend his money.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file ddayz.out):

5

Problem 8: The Grove [Hardi Pertel, Estonia, 2005]

The pasture contains a small, contiguous grove of trees that has
no 'holes' in the middle of the it.  Bessie wonders: how far is it
to walk around that grove and get back to my starting position?
She's just sure there is a way to do it by going from her start
location to successive locations by walking horizontally, vertically,
or diagonally and counting each move as a single step. Just looking
at it, she doesn't think you could pass 'through' the grove on a
tricky diagonal. Your job is to calculate the minimum number of
steps she must take.

Happily, Bessie lives on a simple world where the pasture is
represented by a grid with R rows and C columns (1 &lt;= R &lt;= 50, 1
&lt;= C &lt;= 50). Here's a typical example where '.' is pasture (which
Bessie may traverse), 'X' is the grove of trees, '*' represents
Bessie's start and end position, and '+' marks one shortest path
she can walk to circumnavigate the grove (i.e., the answer):

...+...
..+X+..
.+XXX+.
..+XXX+
..+X..+
...+++*

The path shown is not the only possible shortest path; Bessie might
have taken a diagonal step from her start position and achieved a
similar length solution. Bessie is happy that she's starting 'outside'
the grove instead of in a sort of 'harbor' that could complicate
finding the best path.

PROBLEM NAME: grove

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: R and C

* Lines 2..R+1: Line i+1 describes row i with C characters (with no
        spaces between them).

SAMPLE INPUT (file grove.in):

6 7
.......
...X...
..XXX..
...XXX.
...X...
......*

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The single line contains a single integer which is the
        smallest number of steps required to circumnavigate the grove.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file grove.out):

13
