                           BRONZE PROBLEMS
**********************************************************************
                  Three problems numbered 11 through 13
**********************************************************************

Problem 11: Securing the Barn [Traditional, 2005]

Farmer John has installed a new security system on the barn and now
must issue a valid password to the cows in the herd. A valid password
consists of L (3 &lt;= L &lt;= 15) different lower-case characters (from the
traditional latin character set 'a'...'z'), has at least one vowel
('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u'), at least two consonants (non-vowels),
and has characters that appear in alphabetical order (i.e., 'abc'
is valid; 'bac' is not).

Given a desired length L along with C lower-case characters, write a
program to print all the valid passwords of length L that can be formed
from those letters. The passwords must be printed in alphabetical order,
one per line.

PROBLEM NAME: passwd

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, L and C

* Line 2: C space-separated lower-case characters that are the set of
        characters from which to build the passwords

SAMPLE INPUT (file passwd.in):

4 6
a t c i s w

INPUT DETAILS:

Passwords of length 4 chosen from the given six characters

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Lines 1..?: Each output line contains a word of length L characters
        (and no spaces). The output lines must appear in alphabetical
        order.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file passwd.out):

acis
acit
aciw
acst
acsw
actw
aist
aisw
aitw
astw
cist
cisw
citw
istw

Problem 12: Hopscotch [Hal Burch, 2005]

The cows play the child's game of hopscotch in a non-traditional
way.  Instead of a linear set of numbered boxes into which to hop,
the cows create a 5x5 rectilinear grid of digits parallel to the
x and y axes.

They then adroitly hop onto any digit in the grid and hop forward,
backward, right, or left (never diagonally) to another digit in the
grid. They hop again (same rules) to a digit (potentially a digit
already visited).

With a total of five intra-grid hops, their hops create a six-digit
integer (which might have leading zeroes like 000201).

Determine the count of the number of distinct integers that can be
created in this manner.

PROBLEM NAME: numgrid

INPUT FORMAT:

* Lines 1..5: The grid, five integers per line

SAMPLE INPUT (file numgrid.in):

1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 2 1
1 1 1 1 1

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The number of distinct integers that can be constructed

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file numgrid.out):

15

OUTPUT DETAILS:

111111, 111112, 111121, 111211, 111212, 112111, 112121, 121111, 121112,
121211, 121212, 211111, 211121, 212111, and 212121 can be constructed.  No
other values are possible.

Problem 13: Satellite Photographs [Rob Kolstad, 2005]

Farmer John purchased satellite photos of W x H pixels of his farm
(1 &lt;= W &lt;= 80, 1 &lt;= H &lt;= 1000) and wishes to determine the largest
'contiguous' (connected) pasture. Pastures are contiguous when any
pair of pixels in a pasture can be connected by traversing adjacent
vertical or horizontal pixels that are part of the pasture.  (It is
easy to create pastures with very strange shapes, even circles that
surround other circles.)

Each photo has been digitally enhanced to show pasture area as an
asterisk ('*') and non-pasture area as a period ('.').  Here is a
10 x 5 sample satellite photo:
 
..*.....**
.**..*****
.*...*....
..****.***
..****.***
 
This photo shows three contiguous pastures of 4,  16, and 6 pixels.  
Help FJ find the largest contiguous pasture in each of his satellite
photos.

PROBLEM NAME: satpix

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: W and H

* Lines 2..H+1: Each line contains W "*" or "." characters
        representing one raster line of a satellite photograph.

SAMPLE INPUT (file satpix.in):

10 5
..*.....**
.**..*****
.*...*....
..****.***
..****.***

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The size of the largest contiguous field in the satellite
        photo.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file satpix.out):

16
