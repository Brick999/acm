                  Three problems numbered 6 through 8

Problem 6: City skyline [Mathijs Vogelzang, 2005]

The best part of the day for Farmer John's cows is when the sun
sets. They can see the skyline of the distant city. Bessie wonders
how many buildings the city has. Write a program that assists the
cows in calculating the minimum number of buildings in the city,
given a profile of its skyline.

The city in profile is quite dull architecturally, featuring only
box-shaped buildings. The skyline of a city on the horizon is
somewhere between 1 and W units wide (1 &lt;= W &lt;= 1,000,000) and
described using N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 50,000) successive x and y coordinates
(1 &lt;= x &lt;= W, 0 &lt;= y &lt;= 500,000), defining at what point the skyline
changes to a certain height.

An example skyline could be:
..........................
.....XX.........XXX.......
.XXX.XX.......XXXXXXX.....
XXXXXXXXXX....XXXXXXXXXXXX

and would be encoded as (1,1), (2,2), (5,1), (6,3), (8,1), (11,0), (15,2),
(17,3), (20,2), (22,1).

This skyline requires a minimum of 6 buildings to form; below is
one possible set of six buildings whose could create the skyline
above:

..........................    ..........................
.....22.........333.......    .....XX.........XXX.......
.111.22.......XX333XX.....    .XXX.XX.......5555555.....
X111X22XXX....XX333XXXXXXX    4444444444....5555555XXXXX

..........................
.....XX.........XXX.......
.XXX.XX.......XXXXXXX.....
XXXXXXXXXX....666666666666

PROBLEM NAME: skyline

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space separated integers: N and W

* Lines 2..N+1: Two space separated integers, the x and y coordinate
        of a point where the skyline changes. The x coordinates are
        presented in strictly increasing order, and the first x
        coordinate will always be 1.

SAMPLE INPUT (file skyline.in):

10 26
1 1
2 2
5 1
6 3
8 1
11 0
15 2
17 3
20 2
22 1

INPUT DETAILS:

The case mentioned above

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The minimum number of buildings to create the described
        skyline.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file skyline.out):

6

Problem 7: Cow Acrobats [Brian Dean, 2004]

Farmer John's N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 50,000) cows (numbered 1..N) are planning
to run away and join the circus.  Their hoofed feet prevent them
from tightrope walking and swinging from the trapeze (and their
last attempt at firing a cow out of a cannon met with a dismal
failure). Thus, they have decided to practice performing acrobatic
stunts.

The cows aren't terribly creative and have only come up with one
acrobatic stunt: standing on top of each other to form a vertical
stack of some height.  The cows are trying to figure out the order
in which they should arrange themselves within this stack.

Each of the N cows has an associated weight (1 &lt;= W_i &lt;= 10,000)
and strength (1 &lt;= S_i &lt;= 1,000,000,000).  The risk of a cow
collapsing is equal to the combined weight of all cows on top of
her (not including her own weight, of course) minus her strength
(so that a stronger cow has a lower risk).  Your task is to determine
an ordering of the cows that minimizes the greatest risk of collapse
for any of the cows.

PROBLEM NAME: acrobat

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single line with the integer N.

* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 describes cow i with two space-separated
        integers, W_i and S_i.

SAMPLE INPUT (file acrobat.in):

3
10 3
2 5
3 3

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer, giving the largest risk of all the cows in
        any optimal ordering that minimizes the risk.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file acrobat.out):

2

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Put the cow with weight 10 on the bottom. She will carry the other
two cows, so the risk of her collapsing is 2+3-3=2. The other cows
have lower risk of collapsing.

Problem 8: Ant Counting [Jacob Steinhardt, 2005]

Bessie was poking around the ant hill one day watching the ants
march to and fro while gathering food.  She realized that many of
the ants were siblings, indistinguishable from one another.  She
also realized the sometimes only one ant would go for food, sometimes
a few, and sometimes all of them. This made for a large number of
different sets of ants!

Being a bit mathematical, Bessie started wondering.  Bessie noted
that the hive has T (1 &lt;= T &lt;= 1,000) families of ants which she
labeled 1..T (A ants altogether).  Each family had some number Ni
(1 &lt;=  Ni &lt;= 100) of ants.

How many groups of sizes S, S+1, ..., B (1 &lt;= S &lt;= B &lt;= A) can be
formed?

While observing one group, the set of three ant families was seen
as {1, 1, 2, 2, 3}, though rarely in that order. The possible sets
of marching ants were:

  3 sets with 1 ant:  {1} {2} {3}
  5 sets with 2 ants: {1,1} {1,2} {1,3} {2,2} {2,3}
  5 sets with 3 ants: {1,1,2} {1,1,3} {1,2,2} {1,2,3} {2,2,3}
  3 sets with 4 ants: {1,2,2,3} {1,1,2,2} {1,1,2,3}
  1 set  with 5 ants: {1,1,2,2,3}

Your job is to count the number of possible sets of ants given the
data above.

PROBLEM NAME: ants

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: 4 space-separated integers: T, A, S, and B

* Lines 2..A+1: Each line contains a single integer that is an ant
        type present in the hive

SAMPLE INPUT (file ants.in):

3 5 2 3
1
2
2
1
3

INPUT DETAILS:

Three types of ants (1..3); 5 ants altogether.  How many sets of size 2 or
size 3 can be made?

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The number of sets of size S..B (inclusive) that can be
        created. A set like {1,2} is the same as the set {2,1} and
        should not be double-counted. Print only the LAST SIX DIGITS
        of this number, with no leading zeroes or spaces.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file ants.out):

10

OUTPUT DETAILS:

5 sets of ants with two members; 5 more sets of ants with three members
