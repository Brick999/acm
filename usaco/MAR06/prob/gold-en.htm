                           GOLD PROBLEMS
**********************************************************************
                  Three problems numbered 1 through 3
**********************************************************************

Problem 1: Ski Lift [Adam Rosenfield, 2004]

Farmer Ron in Colorado is building a ski resort for his cows (though
budget constraints dictate construction of just one ski lift). The
lift will be constructed as a monorail and will connect a concrete
support at the starting location to the support at the ending
location via some number of intermediate supports, each of height
0 above its land. A straight-line segment of steel connects every
pair of adjacent supports. For obvious reasons, each section of
straight steel must lie above the ground at all points.

Always frugal, FR wants to minimize the number of supports that he
must build. He has surveyed the N (2 &lt;= N &lt;= 5,000) equal-sized
plots of land the lift will traverse and recorded the integral
height H (0 &lt;= H &lt;= 1,000,000,000) of each plot. Safety regulations
require FR to build adjacent supports no more than K (1 &lt;= K &lt;= N
- 1) units apart. The steel between each pair of supports is rigid
and forms a straight line from one support to the next.

Help FR compute the smallest number of supports required such that:
each segment of steel lies entirely above (or just tangent to) each
piece of ground, no two consecutive supports are more than K units
apart horizontally, and a support resides both on the first plot
of land and on the last plot of land.

PROBLEM NAME: skilift

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separate integers, N and K

* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains a single integer that is the height
        of plot i.

SAMPLE INPUT (file skilift.in):

13 4

1
0
2

9
11
12

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer equal to the fewest number of lift towers
        FR needs to  build subject to the above constraints

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file skilift.out):

5

OUTPUT DETAILS:

FR builds five supports (at locations 1, 5, 7, 9, and 13). The steel
is tangent to the ground at four locations: 1-5, 5-7, 7-9, and
12-13.

If FR only builds supports at the four locations 1, 5, 9, and 13,
then the steel would be below ground from 5-9. If FR built supports
at 1, 7, and 13, then -- although the steel is always above ground
-- supports 7 and 13 are more than 4 units apart horizontally. There
is no solution using fewer than 5 supports such that no two consecutive
supports are more than 4 units apart horizontally.

Problem 2: Milk Team Select [Percy Liang, 2002]

Farmer John's N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 500) cows are trying to select the
milking team for the world-famous Multistate Milking Match-up (MMM)
competition. As you probably know, any team that produces at least
X (1 &lt;= X &lt;= 1,000,000) gallons of milk is a winner.

Each cow has the potential of contributing between -10,000 and
10,000 gallons of milk. (Sadly, some cows have a tendency to knock
over jugs containing milk produced by other cows.)

The MMM prides itself on promoting family values. FJ's cows have
no doubt that they can produce X gallons of milk and win the contest,
but to support the contest's spirit, they want to send a team with
as many parent-child relationships as possible (while still producing
at least X gallons of milk). Not surprisingly, all the cows on FJ's
farm are female.

Given the family tree of FJ's cows and the amount of milk that each
would contribute, compute the maximum number of parent-child
relationships that can exist in a winning team. Note that a set of
cows with a grandmother-mother-daughter combination has two
parent-child relationships (grandmother-mother, mother-daughter).

PROBLEM NAME: tselect

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and X.

* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains two space-separated integers
        describing cow i. The first integer is the number of gallons
        of milk cow i would contribute. The second integer (range
        1..N) is the index of the cow's mother. If the cow's mother is
        unknown, the second number is 0. The family information has no
        cycles: no cow is her own mother, grandmother, etc.

SAMPLE INPUT (file tselect.in):

5 8
-1 0
3 1
5 1
-3 3
2 0

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 5 cows. Cow 1 can produce -1 gallons and has two daughters, cow
2 and 3, who can produce 3 and 5 gallons, respectively. Cow 3 has a
daughter (cow 4) who can produce -3 gallons. Then there's cow 5, who can
produce 2 gallons.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The maximum number of parent-child relationships possible on
        a winning team. Print -1 if no team can win.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file tselect.out):

2

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The best team consists of cows 1, 2, 3, and 5. Together they produce
(-1)+3+5+2 = 9 &gt;= 8 gallons and have 2 parent-child relationships
(1--2 and 1--3). Note that a team with cows 2, 3, and 5 would be
able to produce more milk (10 gallons), but would have fewer
parent-child relationships (0).

Problem 3: Mooo [Brian Dean, 2005]

Farmer John's N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 50,000) cows are standing in a very
straight row and mooing. Each cow has a unique height h in the range
1..2,000,000,000 nanometers (FJ really is a stickler for precision).
Each cow moos at some volume v in the range 1..10,000. This "moo"
travels across the row of cows in both directions (except for the
end cows, obviously). Curiously, it is heard only by the closest
cow in each direction whose height is strictly larger than that of
the mooing cow (so each moo will be heard by 0, 1 or 2 other cows,
depending on whether or not taller cows exist to the mooing cow's
right or left).

The total moo volume heard by given cow is the sum of all the moo
volumes v for all cows whose mooing reaches the cow. Since some
(presumably taller) cows might be subjected to a very large moo
volume, FJ wants to buy earmuffs for the cow whose hearing is most
threatened. Please compute the loudest moo volume heard by any cow.

PROBLEM NAME: mooo

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer, N.

* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains two space-separated integers, h and
        v, for the cow standing at location i.

SAMPLE INPUT (file mooo.in):

3
4 2
3 5
6 10

INPUT DETAILS:

Three cows: the first one has height 4 and moos with volume 2, etc.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The loudest moo volume heard by any single cow.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file mooo.out):

7

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The third cow hears both the first and second cows moo 2+5=7.  Though the
third cow moos with volume 10, no one hears her.
