<h2>USACO DEC06 Problem 'fewcoins' Analysis</h2>
<h4>by Bruce Merry</h4>
Let's start by looking at just the problem of deciding how to make the change,
given what Farmer John is going to pay. This is a fairly well-known dynamic
programming problem, which can be solved by using the following recurrence: the
best way to make amount C with coins 1..N is either to do it with coins 1..N-1,
or to make change C-VN with coins 1..N and add a VN.

Working out the most efficient way for FJ to pay an amount M is slightly
trickier, because he has a limited number of each coin. Instead, we can use the
following recurrence: the best way to make amount M with coins 1..N is to use
0&lt;=k&lt;=CN coins of VN plus C-k.VN with coins 1..N-1, taking the minimum over all k.

Thus, once we know how much FJ is going to pay, we can compute the total number
of coins required. Of course, we can run the DPs just once each (up to a
maximum value) rather than for every amount that FJ might pay. The only catch
is that we need to determine the maximum. Of course, FJ cannot pay more than
all the coins in his possession, but it is possible to do better. Let V be the
largest coin value, and call this type of coin silver and all other coins
brass. It is not difficult to prove that for any change amount of at least V^2,
it is possible to use at least one silver coin (hint: consider the partial sums
modulo V), and hence that in making change of at least 2V^2 there can be at
least V silver coins. Now if Farmer John pays at least 2V^2, and hence pays
with V coins, then a similar argument shows that some set of them adds up to a
multiple of V and at most V^2, which can be cancelled out with the silver coins
in the change. So the change amount can never exceed 2V^2. In fact it is
possible to show tighter bounds (such as V^2),but that is left as an exercise.

If implemented directly, this gives an algorithm that is O((T+V^2)NC), which at
~10^9 operations will most likely be too slow. One area that can easily be
optimised is the inner-most loop, which determines the optimum number of coins
of each type for FJ to use. It looks for the minimum of old[t - k*v] + k, where
i is the total under consideration, v is the value of the coin under
consideration and k ranges from 0 to c inclusive (c being the number of v's).
If we define tilted[i%v][i/v] = old[i]-i/v then the expression we seek becomes
min(tilted[t % v][t / v - k]) + t / v. By moving the offset outside of the
minimum and splitting up the cases by modulus, we reduce the problem to one of
finding the minimum from a range of values. What is worth noting is that the
ranges we will use the same array multiple times, and each time the range we
seek is just shifted over by 1. There exist some extremely sophisticated
algorithms that provide constant-time range-min queries, but they are overkill
for this specialised situation. Instead, we can preprocess the array to
determine, for each i, the smallest j &gt; i such that arr[j] &lt; arr[i]. We can do
this by working through the array, keeping a stack of the i values for which we
have not yet seen any such j. Each time we see a new value j, we can finalise
stack entries for which arr[i] &gt; arr[j], before pushing j onto the stack (a
similar algorithm can be used to solve Empodia from IOI 2004). To determine the
smallest value in each range as we proceed, we simply keep track of the
smallest index. If the previous smallest drops out of the window, start from
the left of the window and keep following the "next smaller" pointer until the
new smallest is found.

With this optimisation, the search becomes amortised constant time per query,
so the efficiency is O((T+V^2)N).
