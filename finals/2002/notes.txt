A  Balloons in a Box        very simple geometry, brute-force all n! permutations
B  Undecodable Codes        [dp]
C  Crossing the Desert
D  Ferries                  [dp]
E  Island Hopping           minimum spanning tree, simple
F  Toil for Oil             [geometry, line sweep]
G  Partitions               infimum=union of pictures
                            supremum=intersection + some fixup
H  Silly Sort               decompose permutation into cycles, and for each 
                            cycle consider two possibilities of sorting it -
                            using the cycle's minimum element or global minimum
