<p>Fred is a robotic mouse built by a group of students of
artificial intelligence. Fred can move around in the labyrinth shown
in the picture below. Whenever Fred comes to a place marked by a
number, he has to choose one of the possible directions. Behavior of the
mouse should look chaotic and complex enough so that it will impress
students' supervisor. </p> <div align="center"><center>

<p>Numbered places in the labyrinth are called nodes. Fred has
one integer <em>X</em> stored in its memory and can perform some
calculations. In each node (except node 1) he chooses
a direction according to <em>X</em>, decreases <em>X</em> by 1
and goes to the chosen node. The direction is chosen according to
this rules: </p>

<pre><strong>Node 2:</strong> Compute X mod 3.
        If the result is 0, go to 7
                         1, go to 1
                         2, go to 4.

<strong>Node 4:</strong> Let Y be X written backwards (in decimal system).
        If Y&gt;X then go to 6 otherwise go to 2.

<strong>Node 6:</strong> Compute the number of digits of X (in decimal system).
        If the result is even then go to 4 otherwise go to 7.

<strong>Node 7:</strong> Compute (X*X) mod 7.
        If the result is 0 go to 2
                         1 go to 6
                         2 go to 8
                         4 go to 0.

<strong>Node 8:</strong> Compute X mod 5.
        If the result is 2 or 3 then go to 7 otherwise go to 9.

<strong>Node 9:</strong> If you have come from 8 then go to 0.
        If you have come from 0 then go to 8.

<strong>Node 0:</strong> Let Y be the third least significant digit of X in decimal system
        (if X&lt;100 then Y=0). If Y&lt;=7 then go to 7 otherwise go to 9. </pre>

<p>At the beginning of each experiment, the experimenter puts the
mouse in the node 0 and initializes value <em>X</em> by voice.
After that, the mouse starts to move. The mouse displays current value of
<em>X</em> on its digital display. The experiment finishes when the mouse
enters the node 1, the result of the experiment is the number displayed. If
the value of <em>X</em> decreases to zero, the experiment fails and its
result is -1. </p>

<H3>Input specification</H3>

<p>
The input file contains
several initial values of <em>X</em> as they were told by
the experimenter.
</p>

<H3>Output specification</H3>

<p>
For each value of <em>X</em>
in the input file write to a separate line of the output file the
result of the corresponding experiment (see example output). </p>
