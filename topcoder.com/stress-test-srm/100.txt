Problem Statement
    
We are looking for occurrences of the string "red" in a piece of text. For example, in the text

    the detective questioned his credibility
we find "red" inside the word "credibility".
Capitalization doesn't matter, so in the text

    Server ERRED in Redirecting Spam
we find "red" at the end of "ERRED", as well as at the beginning of "Redirecting".
Given a string, count the number of times "red" appears in it with any capitalization.
